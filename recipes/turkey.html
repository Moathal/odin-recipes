            This method works with turkeys weighing 12 to 20 pounds. 
            Increase cooking time to reach safe internal temperature, approximately 30 minutes per pound.

        <p>
            Check the water pan every 2 to 4 hours and add hot water as needed. Add damp wood chips as needed to maintain cooking temperature at 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place turkey in a roasting pan. Rub salt all over and inside turkey. Let sit for 1 hour.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat smoker to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). If your smoker is equipped with a water pan, fill it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Rinse salt off turkey and pat dry with paper towels. Return to roasting pan and baste with melted better. Cover with aluminum foil and place in smoker.

            <li>
                Cook for about 3 hours; remove aluminum foil. Continue to cook, uncovered, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the turkey thigh reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 3 to 3 1/2 hours.
